* Complete visual editing of multi-layered flatbuffer schemas with pull down lists for supported data types, support for nested types, etc..
* Ability to export a schema file from a visual definition.
* Ability to import a schema file and have a visualization of that schema you can use to edit.
* Ability to copy and paste schema definitions in and out of the tool as a substitute for using files.

## Usage Instructions
1. Run `npm start` to start the hot reload server.
2. Go to `localhost:3000` to view the app.
